Review code changes and identify missing documentation updates.

## README.md (Human Documentation)

Check if changes require README updates:

Must document:
- New features or capabilities
- New CLI flags or command-line options
- New API endpoints or interfaces
- New configuration options
- Changed behavior that affects users
- New dependencies or system requirements
- Breaking changes

Skip:
- Internal refactoring with no user-visible changes
- Bug fixes that restore documented behavior
- Test additions
- Code style changes

## CLAUDE.md (AI Knowledge Base)

Check if changes require CLAUDE.md updates:

Must document:
- New architectural patterns discovered/established
- New conventions or coding standards
- New build/test commands
- New libraries or tools integrated
- Project structure changes
- Workflow changes
- Non-obvious debugging techniques

Skip:
- Standard code additions following existing patterns
- Simple bug fixes
- Test additions using existing patterns

## Plan Files

If changes relate to an existing plan:
- Mark completed items as done
- Update plan status if needed
- Note which plan items this change addresses

## What to Report

For each gap:
- Missing: what needs to be documented
- Section: where in the documentation it should go
- Suggested content: draft text or outline

Report problems only - no positive observations.
