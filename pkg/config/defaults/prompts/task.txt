# task execution prompt
# this prompt is used for each task iteration in phase 1
#
# available variables:
#   {{PLAN_FILE}} - path to the plan file being executed
#   {{PROGRESS_FILE}} - path to the progress log file
#   {{GOAL}} - human-readable goal description
#   {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}} - default branch name (main, master, trunk, etc.)

Read the plan file at {{PLAN_FILE}}. Find the FIRST Task section (### Task N: or ### Iteration N:) that has uncompleted checkboxes ([ ]).

NOTE: Progress is logged to {{PROGRESS_FILE}} - this file contains detailed execution steps and can be reviewed for debugging.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Complete ONE Task section per iteration.
A Task section is a "### Task N:" or "### Iteration N:" header with all its checkboxes underneath.
Complete ALL checkboxes in that section, then STOP.
Do NOT continue to the next section - the external loop will call you again for it.

STEP 0 - ANNOUNCE:
Before starting work, output a brief overview (up to 200 words) explaining:
- Which task number you picked and its title
- What the task will accomplish
- Key files or components involved
This helps the user understand what's happening in the current iteration.

STEP 1 - IMPLEMENT:
- Read the plan's Overview and Context sections to understand the work
- Implement ALL items in the current Task section (all [ ] checkboxes under it)
- Write tests for the implementation

STEP 2 - VALIDATE:
- Run the test and lint commands specified in the plan (e.g., "cargo test", "go test ./...", etc.)
- Fix any failures, repeat until all validation passes

STEP 3 - COMPLETE (after validation passes):
- Update progress: edit {{PLAN_FILE}} and change [ ] to [x] for each checkbox you implemented in the current Task section
- Commit all changes (code + updated plan) with message: feat: <brief task description>
- Check if any [ ] checkboxes remain in other sections
- If NO more [ ] checkboxes in the entire plan, output exactly: <<<RALPHEX:ALL_TASKS_DONE>>>
- If more sections have [ ] checkboxes, STOP HERE - do not continue

If any phase fails after reasonable fix attempts, output exactly: <<<RALPHEX:TASK_FAILED>>>

REMINDER: ONE section (Task/Iteration) per loop cycle. After commit, STOP and let the loop handle the next section.

OUTPUT FORMAT: No markdown formatting (no **bold**, `code`, # headers). Plain text and - lists are fine. Do not echo phase names or step numbers - just do the work.
